# FitTrack

A fitness tracking PWA. Data is stored locally in the browser via IndexedDB and works fully offline — cloud sync and multi-device auth are entirely optional add-ons.

## Cloud Sync (optional)

The app runs fully local-only with zero configuration — no `.env` file needed. To enable optional cross-device sync and sign-in via Supabase:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from your Supabase project (Settings → API), and apply [supabase/schema.sql](./supabase/schema.sql) in the SQL Editor (creates the tables and row-level-security policies). Leave both env vars unset to run fully offline/local — the app behaves identically either way, just without an auth gate or cross-device sync. `.env.local` is gitignored — never commit your Supabase keys.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some Oxlint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the Oxlint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend enabling type-aware lint rules by installing `oxlint-tsgolint` and editing `.oxlintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/oxlint/configuration_schema.json",
  "plugins": ["react", "typescript", "oxc"],
  "options": {
    "typeAware": true
  },
  "rules": {
    "react/rules-of-hooks": "error",
    "react/only-export-components": ["warn", { "allowConstantExport": true }]
  }
}
```

See the [Oxlint rules documentation](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter/rules) for the full list of rules and categories.
